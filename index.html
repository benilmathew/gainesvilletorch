      <h2>About the Kairos Torch Program</h2>
         <p>Kairos Torch offers unconditional love and acceptance, encouraging male and female incarcerated youth age 25 and under to share their life journey through participation in a long-term mentoring process.</p>

 <p>The mission of the 2 ½ day Introductory Weekend is to encourage the participants to remove their mask, so that the real person can shine forth – rather that who they pretend to be. </p>

 <p>Kairos Torch creates a safe place for the youthful offender to realize their God given potential in a Christian setting that encourages the sharing their life’s journey, and moves them toward making better choices for their lives.</p>

 <p>Sadly for some, this is the first tie in their lives that they have freely received compassion and love. 
The Weekend is followed by a continuing ministry that includes six months of bi-weekly one-to-one mentoring of the youth by Kairos volunteers and monthly group Reunions.</p>

 <p>The mentors begin each session with a Bible verse and use a structured guide as a springboard to discuss topics such as self-esteem, anger management, parental relationships, short and long-term goal setting, and forgiveness.</p>

  <p>The impact and benefit of the program is that the participants attain a renewed sense of themselves, build self-esteem, begin to make construction life choices and establish positive relations and community – all of which results in hope for the future and a change to break the cycle of crimes. </p>


      <h3>About Kairos</h3>
      <p>Kairos has more than 30,000 volunteers who serve in 500+ prisons and communities in 37 states and 10 foreign countries. </p>
      <p>Kairos sprang from the Cursillo movement and is supported by volunteers from the 4th Day ministries such as Cursillo, Via De Cristo, Walk to Emmaus, and Tres Dias as well as volunteers from Christian churches.  Kairos embraces a diverse group of volunteers working together to fulfill Christ’s call to action in Mathew 25:36.</p>

      <h3>Kairos- Three Programs, One Ministry</h3>
      <p>Each of the three Kairos Programs (Kairos Inside, Kairos Outside, and Kairos Torch) has a unique targeted audience, but the core program is essentially the same.</p>
      <p>“Better Together” describes how the three programs working together positive impacts individuals, families and society.  The incarcerated adult of youth and their female love ones attend Kairos programs, they have a parallel experience.</p>
      <p>That experience provides a common bond, a shared experience, which can create a unique and exponentially positive effect on the family unit.  It can also enable unity, positive dialogue, new beginnings, restoration, and hope.</p>

      <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
      <p>The people of Kairos are called by God to share the love of Christ with those impacted by incarceration. Kairos encourages believers from a variety of Christian traditions to be volunteers in this Christ-filled ministry. Kairos programs offer to prison residents, their families, and those who work with them, the opportunity to receive God’s forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ, and to grow in their faith and servanthood in Christian community. We stand on the common ground of the following elements of faith: We in Kairos believe: The Bible is God’s authoritative and inspired word for our faith and our lives; In the Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; in the deity, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ; friendship with God is a free gift, for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. The love of Jesus Christ motivates His followers to provide food for the hungry, drink to the thirsty, welcome to the stranger, clothes for the naked, and visits to the sick and those in prison. We share the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ with all incarcerated individuals, their families and to those who work with them inside and outside the correctional institution.</p>
